This problem demonstrates the use of semaphores to coordinate three types ofprocesses.6 Santa Claus sleeps in his shop at the North Pole and can only be wakenedby either (1) all nine reindeer being back from their vacation in the South Pacific, or(2) some of the elves having difficulties making toys; to allow Santa to get some sleep,the elves can
only wake him when three of them have problems.When three elves arehaving their problems solved, any other elves wishing to visit Santa must wait forthose elves to return. If Santa wakes up to find three elves waiting at his shopâ€™s door,along with the last reindeer having come back from the tropics, Santa has decidedthat the elves can wait until after Christmas, because it is more important to get hissleigh ready. (It is assumed that the reindeer do not want to leave the tropics, andtherefore they stay there until the last possible moment.) The last reindeer to arrivemust get Santa while the others wait in a warming hut before being harnessed to thesleigh. Using synchronization tools like locks, semaphores and monitorsprovide a solution to this problem
